# Immoweb Data Analysis and Cleaning Project

## Overview
This project involves data analysis and cleaning of real estate listings scraped from Immoweb, a popular property listing website in Belgium.

- **Municipality Price Analysis**: 
  - Determined the most and least expensive municipalities in Belgium, Flanders, and Wallonia based on average price, median price, and price per square meter.
- **Property Distribution**: Visualized the distribution of properties according to their surface area using histograms.
- **Variable Importance**: Evaluated and ranked the importance of various features influencing property prices.
