### Step 3: Data Interpretation

- Plot the outliers.
- Which variables would you delete and why ?
- Represent the number of properties according to their surface using a histogram.
- In your opinion, which 5 variables are the most important and why?
- What are the most expensive municipalities in Belgium? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the most expensive municipalities in Wallonia? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the most expensive municipalities in Flanders? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the less expensive municipalities in Belgium? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the less expensive municipalities in Wallonia? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the less expensive municipalities in Flanders? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)


## Plots Must-Have

- A descriptive title.
- Legends where appropriate.
- Properly labeled axes, including units.
- Thoughtful use of colors.
- Comparable scales when comparing data.
- Avoid overlapping text to improve readability.


## Remarks
- Cool idea to show the distribution of building states across provinces and distribution of houses/appartments counts per province
- Nice correlation analysis (except maybe for the terrace one and face number which are less interesting I think) but a bit too descriptive and not actionable enough. What does it say? What can we assume or do?
- You did not answer all outlined questions in your presentation, you focused too much on correlation
- project architecture could be improved a bit by adding subfolders (data, src,...)
- code not very clean, not a lot of comments and huge notebooks
- no readme
- 1 useless branch on github, don't forget to clean it at the end of a project
- It's good work :fire: but it could have been better with some cleaning. You were only 2 so I understand it was not the priority.
